Paint Clone

ZTM project that replicates basic version of MS Paint.
It utilizes [Canvas HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) element and [Mouse Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) to allow for creation of lines and shapes.
[localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) gives the user the option to save current work in local memory and with [dataToURL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL) the application allows for image export in .jpeg format.
